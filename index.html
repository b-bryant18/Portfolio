            <p> I'm currently a full stack development student at the University of Texas. I graduated from Texas A&M in
                2018 with
                a degree in Business and a minor in Economics. I like to be part of a team and working in social
                environments. I've
                wanted to move to Austin for nearly a year in order to pursue a career in the tech industry. I believe
                that becoming
                a developer will challenge me everyday and also provide me with
                a rewarding lifestyle. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Outside of class you can find me running, working out, or at a car show. I look forward to exploring the
                hiking
                trails around Austin and paddleboarding when the weather gets warmer. I'd like to join a club sport like
                obstacle
                course racing so that I can make some new friends.
