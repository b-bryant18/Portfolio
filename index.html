                <p> I'm currently a full stack development student at the University of Texas. I graduated from Texas
                    A&M in
                    2018 with
                    a degree in Business and a minor in Economics. I like to be part of a team and working in social
                    environments. I've
                    wanted to move to Austin for nearly a year in order to pursue a career in the tech industry. I
                    believe
                    that becoming
                    a developer will challenge me everyday and also provide me with
                    a rewarding lifestyle. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Outside of class you can find me running, working out, or at a car show. I look forward to exploring
                    the
                    hiking
                    trails around Austin and paddleboarding when the weather gets warmer. I'd like to join a club sport
                    like
                    obstacle
                    course racing so that I can make some new friends.</p>
